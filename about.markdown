This is the GitHub Pages home for the University of Arizona MIS Department's Academic and Research Technologies Group (ARTG). 

We strive to deliver technical academic and research support for our programs and courses. This is is not only for endeavors within the Management Information Systems department, but also throughout the Eller College of Management and also to other student populations at the University of Arizona.

***We help people through modern and reliable technical pedagogy, academic program quality improvement and student development.***
