### Site setup ###

Our GitHub Pages site was setup with [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the default minima theme. 

We also use the [jekyll-gist](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist) plugin.

We added the callouts based on Cody Clark's [callout example page](https://cody-clark.github.io/2017/07/25/my-example-post.html) and [his github repo](https://github.com/cody-clark/cody-clark.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-07-25-my-example-post.md). It made it much simpler and made me more confident in modifying for our use. Thanks Cody!

I think Cody's work was based on work by [Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) in his [Jekyll Documentation Theme](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll), which appears interesting and excellent.
