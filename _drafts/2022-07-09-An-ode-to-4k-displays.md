When I embarked on my IT career in 2004, I quickly realized the value of having multiple displays. While "virtual desktops" on my old school Macbook Pro and Linux GUIs were certainly nice to have, I much preferred having additional physical displays. I remember scavenging old monitors destined for the surplus property office and making them work with the PC in my cubicle, starting with 1 additonal 1366x768 display and working my way up to 3 mismatched 1080p displays I collected over a number of years. 

Sometime in 2014 I found an article linked from slashdot [by Brian Hauer, whose office purchased low-end (~$500) Seiki 39" 4k monitors for their programmers](https://tiamat.tsotech.com/4k-is-for-programmers). I was able to lobby my employer, the [University of Arizona College of Pharmacy](https://www.pharmacy.arizona.edu), to get me one as a test, in lieu of other technology refresh/upgrades, and quickly fell in love with the setup. I was previously running 3 1080p displays side-by-side-by-side, and switched to 1x 1080p alongside the 39" 4k Seiki, being driven by my HP desktop PC. I recall having to sift through our boxes of spare parts and computers to find a video card that could drive my displays.

### Large-format 4k displays: A love story ###

I immediately noticed the following:
1. It's **really nice** to look at editor/IDE/reference materials in a tall window on a big 4k screen alongside other windows where you're making changes or monitoring progress/output.
2. It's similarly **really nice** to do your editing/change work on a 1080 full-screen window and have output on part of your 4k, along with other things you might be cheecking like e-mail or chat. 
3. A 4k monitor is essentially 4x 1080p monitors in a single panel, and I found it more convenient to manage my workflow on a single panel than on separate physical monitors. I feel strongly that a 4k monitor needs to be large-format to be useful in this way, at least 40"; I now believe 43" to basically ideal for my offices.  
4. It seemed to me both simpler and more cost effective to get a single 4k PC display than to buy and mount 4 individual 1080p displays. Having too many displays arranged side-by-side(-by-side-by-side) is ergonomically taxing to deal with, and I doubt most people would even pay much attention to the 4th display in such a setup. Getting mounts/mounting arms capable of doing 2x2 is tricky and probably expensive.
5. It's also easier (especially these days) to drive a 4k monitor from a single HDMI, DisplayPort or USB-C connection instead of an independent connection for each monitor.
6. I felt pangs of longing when I had to work without my 4k, and knew I'd have to have one at home before too long.

Others in my office didn't rush to replicate the setup back then, turned off by the glitch effect of the 30hz refresh rate, or the slightly-too-small DPI of the 39" screen, or just the comedy of its size. People teasing me about the size would be a recurring theme, but I didn't care, I had become a convert, and if they couldn't appreciate my genius that was their problem. 

Within a matter of months, I secured a 49" [Wasabi Mango UHD490 4k monitor](https://www.amazon.com/WASABI-MANGO-UHD490-49-Inch-Monitor/) for my home computing needs. I bought the monitor on eBay for $800 and it took nearly two months to get to me from overseas, and when it arrived, the instructions and remote control were only in Korean. The 49" form factor had a much better DPI ratio of ~90, comparable to a 24" 1080p display, meaning it could be placed further away from my face on my desk, important since the monitor is so big that I'd have to pan my head to see it all if it's too close. The monitor also purported to support DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 2.0, suggesting that I would finally be able to do 4k@60hz. Indeed, my trusty Surface Pro 3 was able to drive it at 4k resolution at 60hz, so long as I used an "active" mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter and could tolerate the fan noise.

This setup ended up being great for my small space, a combination home office/guest room/gym/den/study, as I could toggle between TV sources like a Roku and back to my computer for work, learning or leisure. Despite there being better options today, I still use this display in my home office, and have since added two 1080p monitors alongside.

When I started at [MIS](https://mis.eller.arizona.edu/) in June of 2015, I knew I was going to want a large-format 4k for my office and [Philips had recently released their 40" BDM4065UC](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/philips-bdm4065uc-40-inch-ultra-hd-monitor,4302.html). I remember telling my boss at the time that I'd even pay for it myself if he couldn't, such was my level of conviction, but he was able to find the $800 to get me one (along with my new PC and a 1080p display I was able to scrounge up). Not long after I did, when folks dropped by the office, after ribbing me a bit about the monitor's size, they'd want to know more about it. I think I was responsible directly for 3-4 other folks in the building having to have one after seeing mine, and who knows what kind of domino effect that led to.

When we hired our assistant director, I wanted to ensure he could have one too, and by then the excellent [43" Dell U4320Q 4k monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-43-4k-usb-c-monitor-u4320q/apd/210-avke/monitors-monitor-accessories) was widely available. This display has become our go-to large-format 4k display when we have a need at work. 

Back at the house, my 4k rampage wasn't over. By this point, TV manufacturers were generally making at least 1 HDMI port on their devices "compatible" with computers by providing 4k@60hz (and other features, like 4:4:4/RGB color space), so it was easier and cheaper than ever to go 4k. I was able to convince my wife of the value of large-format 4k display for work productivity, and in ???? got a cheap Visio 43" 4k display for her space, a combo office/craft loft. The device worked great with her personal Surface Pro 4 and her work-issued devices. 

I also built out my own work-from-home setup a bit more during COVID, adding 2 1080p monitors alongside my trusty 49" Wasabi Mango 4k.

And while we don't use it (yet) for work purposes, we do use our laptops to drive a 75" Visio 6-series 4k TV on a rolling cart at 4k for Zoom and geoguessr purposes. If I could roll it around the house more easily, I could see it becoming a nice 4k addition to my home office for special projects. 



### Getting the most from a 4k setup ###
When choosing your 4k display size, you may want to do some thinking about what DPI/PPI you prefer to have, and choose a display that matches it. I've come to think 43" is just about perfect for me and my eyesight and desks, having had some experience with 39", 40" and 49". I haven't found it necessary to perfectly hit the DPI I want, good enough has been good enough. The goal is to have a display that seems comfortable to look at in native 4k resolution and 100% (no) scaling, while not being so big that you fatigue yourself turning to look at all of it. You probably already have a DPI/PPI preference with your current monitors without really realizing it, so you can work backward from there using a [DPI calculator](https://www.sven.de/dpi/). 

Early on, I found the free tool [Winsplit Revolution](https://winsplit-revolution.en.softonic.com/) to help handle layout of applications on my screens. I made heavy use of its intuitive keyboard shortcuts to quickly resize applications to be 1/2 or 1/3 of the screen and place them into segmented positions on the 4k. For years I would have my e-mail in the bottom-right half of my 4k display, and my calendar in the upper-right, and bring IDE, PDF, `tail` or text editor windows into 2160p heights as needed. Winsplit Revolution made this easy to manage. 

Later, I'd [discover that I could drop a line into .RDP files](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/665.how-to-set-the-monitor-for-a-remote-desktop-session-in-a-multi-monitor-setup.aspx) that would default my remote connections to open full-screen by default on my 4k monitor: `winposstr:s:0,1,1921,1081,3360,900`. This saved me the annoyance of having to resize and move it there myself. My 4k monitors have always been on the right size of my other displays, so you might need different values in the 3rd and 4th positions if you have a different setup.
